Sample Hackday Judging Criteria

__you should replace the detail in the first three points for your event__


# Why are we doing this

Why we put this event on should be fundamental within the minds of people...


# Prizes and categories

See external link.


# Judging Criteria

**Submissions should offer concrete contributions, by example, to the question:**
<blockquote>e.g. How can we build an environment where world class NHS digital services flourish?"</blockquote>

There are a number of things that any project awarded a prize must have, and then a set of different criteria for consideration.



# Red lines - necessities for a prize
 
## Something usable must exist

It must be possible for someone to get some benefit tomorrow from the submission. 

e.g. A usable but buggy system is fine, a set of photoshop layouts of a system is not. Although, any system does not need to be electronic (a card game is considered usable if the cards were for you, and a process/template to create the cards exists).


## It was done over the time period

If people are adding functionality to an existing service, it is only the additional functionality from the weekend that can be considered. 

Submissions offering a (semi-)commercial app that they've worked on for 6 months is an immediate, automatic, non-appealable, disqualification from consideration. That's not a hackday submission, that's a day job.


## Prizes change with reality

Categories can reflect submissions. However shouldn't diverge too radically from what people do.



## Other criteria

These are open, flexible, and non-exhaustive. 


## Most help to the most in need

What is the real world benefit to those who need the most support? Does this submission offer a disproportionate outcome to effort?

e.g. A very flashy iPhone app for booking your Private Hospital dinner should rate much lower than a text message notification reminding people without smartphones of their critical appointments/medication. 


## Do you like it?

That you like it is important - not whether you should, but whether you actually do. Humour also works. Is it actually funny?


## Will it actually work?

Either in practice, or, if you're not sure, at least generate a conversation that is worth having. 


## Hard Problems

A less comprehensive attempt on a very hard problem is at least as good as a flashy attempt on an easy problem. 


## Something incredible by one person is better than something mediocre by a team

Who built something is irrelevant; what is built matters; why it was built can be taken into account (and this may feed into other areas much more strongly).


## Minimally invasive procedures

Submissions that do a more practical job of a key critical aspect, with immediate benefit, even if nothing else at all changes, should be preferred over submissions that require large scale, immediate, fundamental process change.


## Policy grenades

Submissions that expose significant flaws in a Government Policy or a well-funded project, simply by existing, should get an honourable mention (and maybe their presentation sent to the appropriate bit of No 10). 


## Individual prizes

There are some prizes within the grace of particular judges alone. The red lines should apply to those, but the other criteria need not.
